=head1 NAME

RT-Extension-ExcelFeed

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extenstion allows you to generate RT reports in MS Excel XSLX format.
It provides two ways to do this. First, it adds a new MS Excel option to
the 'Feeds' menu on the Query Builder search results page. It also adds
an option to the Dashboard subscription page that allows you to have scheduled
dashboards emailed to recipients as attached MS Excel files rather than
inline HTML reports.

=head1 RT VERSION

Works with RT 4.4.5, 5.0.2

Updates are made in version 0.07 for compatibility with RT 4.4.5 and 5.0.2.
To run with earlier versions of RT, use version 0.06.
