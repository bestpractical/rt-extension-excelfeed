NAME
    RT-Extension-ExcelFeed

DESCRIPTION
    This extenstion allows you to generate RT reports in MS Excel XSLX
    format. It provides two ways to do this. First, it adds a new MS Excel
    option to the 'Feeds' menu on the Query Builder search results page. It
    also adds an option to the Dashboard subscription page that allows you
    to have scheduled dashboards emailed to recipients as attached MS Excel
    files rather than inline HTML reports.
